"She cried, so did moon." - Zora Xu (Ins: @zora.isok)

This wallpaper is interactive. It responses to user's cursor, and raindrop will appear for every click.
It is made by 😈 with love and creativity, a sweet gift to 🐇.
Huge thanks to my friend Zora of her beautiful illustration and support, this wallpaper won't make out without her effort!
